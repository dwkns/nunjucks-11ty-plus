# nunjucks-11ty-plus

nunjucks-11ty-plus is a syntax highlighter for nunjucks files. 

Formatting can be done with [Nunjucks-prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=guapibai.nunjucks-prettier) however it will only really format the HTML in your file. The nunjucks code gets mangled. 

It has some additions that help when you're using [Eleventy (11ty)](http://11ty.dev/) as your website build tool.
